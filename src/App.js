        <p>Ready to make your Gyrotonic website :)</p>Gyrotonic is a training system that combines fluid movements, breathing control and choreographed sequences to improve strength, flexibility, balance and body awareness.
Developed in the 1980s by Romanian dancer Juliu Horvath, Gyrotonic integrates the principles of dance, yoga, Tai Chi, and swimming to create a unique approach to working out the body.
The Gyrotonic is based on a specific device called the "Gyrotonic Expansion System", made up of pulleys, cables and mobile platforms which provide resistance and support for the body during movements.
The holistic approach of Gyrotonic is one of the main pillars of this discipline which considers the body, mind and spirit as a single interconnected entity, promotes overall well-being and favors a better quality of life.
